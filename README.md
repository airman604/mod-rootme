mod_rootme
==========

mod_rootme is a Apache backdoor module that can spawn a root shell.

I used this module while teaching a software security lab.  The module
has been around for a while, but the blog that hosted the most recent
version seems to have disappeared from the web.  Malware detection
programs such as 'rkhunter' and 'unhide' can trivially detect the
presence of mod_root, so it should not be too harmful to have this
code in circulation again.

This repository is imported from an old archive I happened to find
from my old class files (mod_rootme-0.4.tar.gz), updated to build on
Debian GNU/Linux 8.0.

See README.old.txt for the original documentation.
